                        your school is now affiliated to the Cambridge International Education Board. We are a completely
                        Cambridge school for classes Nursery to III and are giving an option for students of Classes IV to IX to
                        appear for the IGCSE/ O level in class X. The AS and A levels for classes XI and XII will follow.
                        IGCSE is one of the most recognised international qualifications in the world. Though we developed and
                        encouraged vital educational skills, including oral skills, investigative skills, problem solving, teamwork and
                        initiative through our global processes, the Cambridge collaboration will further add the international
                        dimension to our teaching learning process. As we prepare our children to be tomorrow’s citizens in the
                        rapidly changing globalised world, the new programme will be infused with international mindedness and
                        intercultural understanding.
